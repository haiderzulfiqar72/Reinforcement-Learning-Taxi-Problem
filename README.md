# Reinforcement-Learning-Taxi-Problem
This project explores Reinforcement Learning techniques to solve the Taxi problem using the OpenAI Gym environment. The Taxi environment is similar to the FrozenLake environment, but with a different layout. The goal is to find an optimal policy for the taxi to efficiently pick up and drop off passengers while navigating through the environment.
